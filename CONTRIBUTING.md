- Follow [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Architecture

- **MVVM pattern** — ViewModel handles UI logic
- **Repository pattern** — Repository abstracts data sources
- **Dependency Injection** — Use Hilt for DI
- **Compose** — All UI in Jetpack Compose

- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repositories
- Use MockK for mocking
- Run tests before submitting PR: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`

### Commit Messages

- `docs:` — documentation
- `refactor:` — code refactoring
- `test:` — adding tests
